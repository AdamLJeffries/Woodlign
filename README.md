# Woodlign
A JavaScript project that showcases my woodturning hobby.
The site is built using VSCode and Node.js. It is a project I intend to one day host and works just like any website. 

How to Run it?
Use Microsoft VSCode and make sure to have Node installed. Then use VSCode's Live Server by clicking "Go Live". The page should launch. There are two APIs that will draw data and no key is required.

The program will Calculate and display data based on an external factor(Days left until Christmas).

It will retrieve data from a third party API and display within the site(Click for Ron Swanson quotes).
